Description: Provides a Toeplitz Inner border inverse scattering solver for optical media
 istib provides a GUI for displaying reflection spectra and
 transforming them into the required spatial refractive index
 modulation profiles. The method used is the Toeplitz Inner
 bordering method developed by Belai et. al. which performs
 Inverse scattering quickly, O(N^2), and accurately (the
 Gel'fand-Levitan-Marchenko Equations are solved exactly.
 A direct scattering (transfer matrix based) method is also
 included to allow system constraints to be included and
 modelled as well as for adaptively altering profiles.
